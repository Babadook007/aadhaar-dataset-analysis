# MapReduce VS Spark - Aadhaar dataset analysis

Analyzing Aadhaar dataset using MapReduce and Spark

## Requirements
- IDE 
- Apache Maven 3.x
- JVM 6 or 7

## Objectives
* Count the number of identities(Aadhaar) generated in each state
* Count the number of identities(Aadhaar) generated by each Enrollment Agency
* Top 10 districts with maximum identities generated for both Male and Female

## General Info
The repository contains both MapReduce and Spark projects MRAadhaarAnalysis and SparkAadhaarAnalysis
* com/stdatalabs/SparkAadhaarAnalysis
     * UIDStats.scala --   Spark code to analyze Aadhaar dataset
* com/stdatalabs/MRAadhaarAnalysis
    * NumUIDMapper.java -- Filters the header and writes (State, Aadhaar_generated) to mapper output
    * NumUIDReducer.java -- Aggregates values for each State that is received as key from the mapper and outputs the State wise identities generated
    * sortMapper.java -- Receives output from previous MR job and swaps the (K, V) pair
    * sortComparator.java -- Sorts the mapper output in descending order before passing to reducer
    * sortReducer.java -- Swaps the (K, V) pair into (State, count) and sends to output file
    * Driver.java -- Driver program for MapReduce jobs

## Description
* A comparison between MapReduce and Apache Spark Dataframes code for analyzing Aadhaar dataset
